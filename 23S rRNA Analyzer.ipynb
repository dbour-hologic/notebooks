    "The purpose of this experiment is to extract all 23S rRNA related data from NCBI/Genbank files. The 23S rRNA is another conserved region in bacteria we can attempt to use for designing scientific assays to detect the specific region as it is thought of as having conserved and unique regions across all bacterial species; allowing us to detect and discriminate between different bacterias within a sample.\n",

    "Biopython will be used to interact with the Entrez API to extract a list of predetermined bacterial species we want. The dataset used for this experiment will be for the vaginal microbiome, approximately 900+ species have been identified residing in the vaginal microbiome according to past studies such as ones done for the analysis of the causitive mechanism of bacterial vaginosis."
